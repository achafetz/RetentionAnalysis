## Overview

#### Focus
- Botswana
    - country team interested
    - USAID comprises of all CBTC
    - district level
- Mozambique
    - has relatively recent DHS
- Review results and determine whether to scale project


#### Model
- Hypothesis: Increased community spending on linkages and adherence/retention --> increase retention relatively
- DV - retention relatively
- IVs
    - spending on linkages & retention/adherence programming
    - spending on FBCTS
    - PEPFAR prioritization
    - SES
    - number on treatment or PLHIV (per capita?)
    - land area
    - rural vs urban districts
    - HIV knowledge perceptions
